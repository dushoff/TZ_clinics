* Visits can be visits, or times when status (dead or LTFU is noted). We don't quite know how this is done or how to interpret non-visit visits.

* We should probably keep the cd4 numbers associated with truncated resultnumeric numbers. We don't need resultnumeric, it seems included in cd4

* status is not coded by visit, but by patient (the status field is redundant and should be the same for every line in a given patient). We have confirmed this.

* arvreasoncode[1-3] have no info, and we will not keep them

* arts_firt_date is essentially equivalent to arts_init_date

* I think we also don't need tbstatuscode

* We don't have to worry for patients with large (>1000) different number of days between firstvisit date and firstvisit with CD4 because that is practically possible in Tanzania.

* We don't have to include children with more than 100kgs of weight in our analysis. There is no missing weight during the first date but this might not be true

* We noticed patients with more than one ART start date and decided to take the first one
